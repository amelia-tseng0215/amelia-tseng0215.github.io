Agatha Chritie's obsession with middle Eastern settings 
<body>
I would like to set my themantic website into a crime fiction blog and focus on the mother of crime fiction- Agtaha Christie. Specifically, I would like to present her obsession with middle Eastern settings in her work and will specifically take <em> Appointment with Death</em> for an example. I would present both Agatha Christie's personal background  and a book analysis related to the topic.
