        At the beginning of 2020, an unknown threat to human’s health emerged in China and soon spread
        to the entire globe rapidly. A new type of coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, is highly
        contagious and causes serious respiratory disease, which has so far killed thousands of people in
        more than 200 countries. Moreover, the accompanying shrinking production and consumption has
        led to the largest global recession since the Great Depression. As experts are still looking for
        solutions, we could learn a lesson from the history of humankind, which is never short of
        examples of worldwide epidemics. At the beginning of 2020, an unknown threat to human’s health emerged in China and soon spread
