        At the beginning of 2020, an unknown threat to humanâ€™s health emerged in China and soon spread
        to the entire globe rapidly. A new type of coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, is highly
        contagious and causes serious respiratory disease, which has so far killed thousands of people in
        more than 200 countries. Moreover, the accompanying shrinking production and consumption has
        led to the largest global recession since the Great Depression. As experts are still looking for
        solutions, we could learn a lesson from the history of humankind, which is never short of
        examples of worldwide epidemics.

        Back to the ancient world, serious plagues had been documented such as the Epic of Gilgamesh or
        the Old Testament of Bible. But the earliest one of well-known epidemics must be the Black
       Death, which broke out in the Middle Age and killed almost one third of the population of Europe.
       At that time, the lack of hygiene knowledge made it hard to cut down the access of spreading and
       protect people against the disease. For instance, people in the Middle Ages almost had no
       able to spread the Black Death among people. Instead, they tended to view the disease as the
       punishment of God or some supernatural power, which was a false belief that prevented patients
       from getting proper treatment. Despite lacking limited hygiene knowledge, some useful methods
       days in a restricted place before entering the port in case there were potential patients on the ship.
       It indicated that people had the concept of sequestering the ill people from the healthy ones, which
       is still the core idea of defeating most epidemics today.
