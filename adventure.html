     Traveling is the quickest way to experience Australian culture and landscapes. The most unforgettable adventure is my travel to the paradise-like Byron Bay, one of the top three gorgeous beaches in Australia.

      This trip was a bit different from most of my trips in Australia because me and my friend decided to make it into a spontaneous getaway trip from the busy world. We did not have any specific itinerary; instead, we led our hearts decide our daily itinerary. Therefore, most of the time, we were immersing ourselves in this authentic Australian costal village and strolling along the beaches. At one night, I suddenly came up with this idea that we should catch the Byron Bay sunrise; thus, we woke up at four and walked in the dark to the beach. Still being half-awake, I took off the shoes, strolled along the beach and stepped my feet 
      in the morning sands and chilling sea water. Not long after, a flaming orange sun just popped out from the horizon, brightening the sky all in a sudden. This moment was the most amazing and forgettable sight I have ever had. Although this might seem to be a common thing for many people, yet waiting in the dark and catching the sunrise at Byron Bay beach gave me a sense of amazement and tranquility.

      Apart from such tranquil experience, a thrilling adventure on the sea was also an unexpected yet memorable experience. Soaking in the sun at the beach in one afternoon, I came across an open sea kayaking advertisement in the tourist guidebook and thus we went open sea kayaking the next morning, which turned out to be the most thrilling thing in this trip! Paddling along the most eastern point of Australia, the costal land view from the sea impressed me of Byron Bay’s natural beauty from a totally different perspective. What’s more, we were so lucky that we saw whales and chased after a group of dolphins! This totally made me forget about the tiresome from paddling against the waves. All in all, the astonishment and thrill in this trip are absolutely beyond descriptions!

       旅遊是認識一個澳洲文化和地理最快的方式。在澳洲的期間，最難忘的旅程墨國於度假勝地拜倫灣¬。拜倫灣也是澳洲最東角，並擁有數一數二美麗的海岸線及海灘。在這為期一星期的旅程，最不同於平常之處是這趟旅程沒有特定的行程安排。每日行程都是前天晚上或是當天隨心情決定。一日漫步在海灘的晚上，臨時決定隔日早起至海灘等日出。在澳洲最東角等待日出，並漫步於海灘的早晨，大概是這趟旅程最愜意的時刻。此外，我和朋友也臨時起意報名了海上獨木舟。拜倫灣的美式無法言喻的。
