    Agatha Christie, born in Britain, was a well-known writer of the Golden Age detective genre. Many of her works are still top-selling books in bookstores such as Murder on the Orient Express and The ABC Murder, etc. 

    After she married her first husband, Colonel Archibald Christie, she devoted herself into writing and published her first mystery, The Mysterious Affair at Styles in 1920. In 1926, Christie published The Murdered of Roger Ackroyd, which was later recognized as the Golden Age’s classic. However, she was traumatized with the facts of her husband’s unloyalty in marriage and her mother’s death; she later divorced Archibald in 1928. Two years after, she met and married her second husband, Max Mallowan, an archaeology professor. Soon after they departed on several expeditions to the Middle East, which she later recounted in the memoir Come, Tell Me How You Live. Her travels with Mallowan to the Middle East contributed inspirations and backgrounds to the Middle Eastern settings in several of her novels. For example, Death on the Nile, Murder in Mesopotamia and The ABC Murder, etc.
