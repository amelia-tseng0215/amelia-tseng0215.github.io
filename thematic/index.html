  <p>
    When it comes to Agatha Christie, most people will first think about the well-received adapted film- Murder on the Oriental Express. This work is indeed one of her best and often makes her readers feel on edge. However, when reading Christie’s marvelous mysteries, people often enjoy themselves in the thrill and suspense too much and seldom notice her particular obsession with the Middle Eastern settings in the books. 
    In this season, we will examine Christie’s Appointment with Death, and take you to read her work from a brand-new perspective!
